# AI / ML Learning Journey

## Overview
This repository documents my structured journey to become an AI/ML Engineer.  
I will consistently upload my learning progress, code practice, notes, experiments, and projects as I build strong foundations in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This repository is not just a collection of files — it reflects my discipline, consistency, and technical growth over time.

## Goals
- Build strong Python foundations for AI/ML  
- Learn Data Analysis using NumPy, Pandas, and Visualization  
- Master Machine Learning algorithms  
- Understand Deep Learning concepts  
- Build real-world projects  
- Become job-ready for AI/ML roles
